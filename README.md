## Programming Pipeline
In order to expedite the development cycle, the addition and revision of code generally adheres to the following process:
1. An issue is opened.
2. The issue is reviewed and assigned to one or more developers.
3. A new branch is created and code is written and modified.
4. The new code is tested live with the robot, and adjustments are made as needed.
5. The new code is merged into the production (`prod`) branch.
